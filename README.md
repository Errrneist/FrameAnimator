## Update
* [20191029] v2.0 changed file type from .avi to .mp4 for better web file formating.

## About
* I am done. Stupid Maya only render pictures and cannot make it into videos.
* Alright, I'll do my own work.
* A simple program that takes in a folder of pictures that Maya rendered and turn them into a video.

## Introduction
* First, go into your render setting and make sure the settings are properly set.
* <img align="right" src="https://github.com/Errrneist/FrameAnimator/blob/master/img/settings.png" alt="Settings" width="700">
* Also make sure render cameras are properly set in Arnold render view.
* Then select "Rendering" workspace, find "Render Sequence" tab under "Render" dropdown.
* Then you will obtain a folder with pngs. 
* Use this script to compose it into a video.
